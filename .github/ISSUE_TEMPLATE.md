## JDBC Input Plugin's Issue Tracker Has Moved

This JDBC Input Plugin is now a part of the [JDBC  Integration Plugin][integration-source];
this project remains open for backports of fixes from that project to the 4.x series where possible, but issues should first be filed on the [integration plugin][integration-issues].

Please post all product and debugging questions on our [forum][logstash-forum].
Your questions will reach our wider community members there, and if we confirm that there is a bug, then we can open a new issue on the appropriate project.
